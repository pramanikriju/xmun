				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>Aditya P. Bhattacharya, Secretary General of XMUN'15, a twelfth grader studying science (read humanities), poses a simple character analysis. He's easily one of the best debaters in the circuit, and has a reputation for solving the Rubik's cube at blinding speeds.</p> <p>But all he seems to care about, is 'med-dling' with a wartime Prime Minister. </p>
<p> His idea of fun, is to be locked up in his room with a copy of The Economist, and his cube. His idea of getting serious, is to be locked up in his room with a copy of the Economist, and his cube. He is a prolific writer and a published poet, with a talent for the melancholy. All in all, he's looking for the leak in life's gas pipe. Don't help him find it. </p>

            <h2>United nations Security Council</h2>
            <p> is a student of class 11 studying humanities and hopes to pursue a career in law. He is keenly interested in sports, especially football and tennis. Unfortunately both Liverpool and Roger Federer seem to have made losing a habit.
Since going to his first MUN in class 9, he has attended several MUNs in the city winning accolades in all of them. He has also had the dubious distinction of being voted the most irritating delegate in most of the MUNs he's attended. That should be enough for you to know what to do.

            <h2>Organization of American States</h2>
             The Chairperson of the Organization of American States, also the Deputy Secretary General of XMUN'15, Ishan Mukerji is one of the most frank and straightforward individuals one is going to come across. The reactions to his outright comments are pretty relative. With an intense passion for Debating, Quizzing, MUNning and (sometimes) mimicry, the OAS Chairperson is a vibrant person to have with you. He shares a strong emotional connect with the millions of other die-hard Indian Cricket fans and is always up for a Debate to discuss and defend the policies of the current Central Government. His interests range from supporting Chelsea Football Club to William Shakespeare, listening to Kishore Kumar to politics and sports. He portrays a strange combination of someone who takes his fitness and stamina seriously and on the other hand is not serious as far as food habits are concerned. Rhetoric is well-appreciated by him but not when it projects superficial intellect. The OAS at XMUN’15 shall undoubtedly be extremely engaging in the presence of Ishan Mukerji whose serious and no-nonsense side shall take over while in Committee and shall make every effort to keep the Delegates involved at each instant. Delegates see you in July. Alea Iacta Est.

            <h2>Hisoric united States Congress</h2>
            <p>Your Chairperson for HUSC is Kanishk Gomes. Having won 

several accolades in MUNs around the city, Kanishk is a 

seasoned MUNner. The self proclaimed 'Elephant' in the 

room, he is a person with a large heart (read: heart disease). 

Extremely friendly and approachable, he hopes, with his 

ability to crack up the most serious of people, to make 

committee as interesting and lively as possible. With 

Kanishk's love for unity, he hopes to chair a committee which 

is entertaining and productive. </p>

            <p>Your chairperson for SIS is Samar Singh, having won 

accolades in every MUN that he has been to, he needs no 

introduction. Samar is a student of the 12th and has taken flak 

for his choice of the humanities stream, yet he doesn’t regret 

it. Not well known for his seriousness, Samar is popularly 

acknowledged as the wannabe Kejriwal. However, do not let 

this persona fool you, as under this lies a delegate whose 

research is meticulous, and a chairperson he demands the 

same.  In spite of joining this school only a year ago, he has 

achieved a lot in a short span of time. His affinity for cricket, 

Indian politics, history and MUNing is evident. With Samar's 

love for meeting people, he hopes that committee is as 

exciting, challenging, productive and realistic as he expects it 

to be.

            <h2>Abwehr</h2>
            <p>Put simply, Sourojit Ghosh, Deputy Secretary General of XMUN '15, is a shady character. It therefore logically follows that he chose as his committee the shady Nazis. His speed and shouting in committees, along with stale one liners makes him an outstanding(often literally) individual in the MUN circuit. Love him or hate him, howsoever often you choose the latter, he's one guy you can't put out of memory easily. Now struggling with class 12 science, he plans to continue his education in the United States. Thankfully, he's chosen a different nation to irritate this time around.</p>
